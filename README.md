# Data URI Converter

With the advent of Data URIs in Camunda Forms Image views, here is a simple utility to convert image files for use in Image views. Instead of using online converters you can use this from the comfort of your own desktop. Clone the repo, open it in your favorite IDE, and run the only class available - io.uri.data.converter.ConvertImageToDataURI. You'll need to pass in the path and file name of the image to be converted as one argument. Copy and paste the output to the Image source field in the form or wherever it's needed.


# TODO / Next steps

- Should probably configure the log level to send out info messages rather than error messages.
- Add images for clarity
